- add simple simulations
+ remove sympy from the algorithm
- fix pendulum w/o small angle approximation
- use numpy wherever possible instead of mixing numpy with lists
- add support for more dimensions (without variables depending on each other)
- add support for variables dependong on each other in more domensions
- add more simulations, including 2D
- (maybe) add some nice plotting to show off
